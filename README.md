# Graph-data-visualization-using-Neo4j : 
Visualization of Wikipedia voters/nominators for adminship

In this project, we are going to create and visualize a graph database using Neo4j on Python. We are using the library py2neo to interact with neo4j.

The dataset used : Wikipedia adminship data from SNAP http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Elec.html

FIRST STEP : PREPROCESSING 

SECOND STEP : building the graph database (nodes and edges/relationships)

THIRD STEP : VISUALIZATION 

LAST STEP : Machine learning ==> Link detection (supervised) and community detection (unsupervised).
